# Vim configuration

My current Vim configuration. It is fairly standard with the addition of Nvim-r and QOL keybinds. 

Packages are managed via pathogen and colorset is colorized dark. 

* surround
* fugitive
* tabular
* airline
* goyo.vim
* easymotion
* tComment
* vim-indent-guides

* NerdTREE
* ConqueGDB
* Nvim-R

## Installation:

```
# Clone repo
git clone git://github.com/levvim/dotvim.git ~/.vim

# Create symlinks:
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
